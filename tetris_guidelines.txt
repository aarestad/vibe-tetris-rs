Introduction
1. Introduction
1.1 What is Tetris?
Tetris® is an electronic puzzle game in which a player manipulates falling Tetriminos (shapes
made from four connected squares) to neatly pack them into horizontal lines which are then
removed from the Matrix to score points.

1.2 Why Tetris?
Tetris is one of the most widely played electronic games of all time. Deceptively simple,
Tetris has defied all gender and age barriers worldwide and has helped shape the minds of
the digital generation. Tetris has infiltrated nearly every computing device that has control
buttons and a screen, from personal computers to dedicated game consoles, from Internetenabled mobile phones to dedicated hand-held game machines, from coin-operated arcade
machines to interactive television, from personal digital assistants to in-flight entertainment
systems. The game is quite simply, just that good.

1.3 How to Play Tetris
Tetris is a game satisfying one of the most basic human drives, that is, to create order out of
chaos. There are seven differently shaped Tetriminos that fall into a rectangular Matrix. As
Tetriminos fall, a player may rotate, move, or drop them into their final resting place. If a row or
more of cells is completely filled with Blocks, then the line or lines are cleared from the Matrix
and points are scored. The more efficiently a player clears lines from the Matrix (for example, in
less time or using more simultaneous Line Clears) the better the player’s score will be. Bonuses
are given for simultaneous Line Clears, special actions called “T-Spins”, and achieving Back-toBack high-point actions.

1.4 Tetris Terminology
For a complete list of terms, refer to the Tetris Glossary.
Back-to-Back: adj. describes two major bonus actions, such as two Tetrises, performed without
a Single, Double, or Triple Line Clear occurring between them.
Block: n. a single block locked in a cell in the Matrix. Also known as an existing Block.
Block Out: n. the Game Over Condition that occurs when part of a newly-generated Tetrimino
is blocked due to an existing Block in the Matrix.
Buffer Zone: n. a 10-cell wide x 20-cell high invisible area above the Matrix used to detect Lock
Out, Block Out, and Top Out Game Over Conditions.
Line Clear: n. when a horizontal row is completely filled with Blocks, it is removed from the
Matrix and is called a Line Clear. All pieces above the Line Clear shift down to fill the space.
Most Tetris variations award scoring or other bonuses for the number of lines cleared at one
time. These are known as “Line Clear Bonuses”.
Lock Down: n. the point at which a Tetrimino in play can no longer be manipulated by the
player. This generally occurs 0.5 seconds after a Tetrimino lands on a Surface.
Lock Out: n. the Game Over Condition occurring when a Tetrimino Locks Down completely
above the Skyline.
Matrix (may-trix): n. the rectangular arrangement of cells creating the active game area,
usually 10 columns wide by 20 rows high. Tetriminos fall from the top-middle just above the
Skyline (off-screen) to the bottom.

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009
Mino (mee-noh): n. a single square-shaped building block of a shape called a Tetrimino. Four
Minos arranged into any of their various connected patterns is known as a Tetrimino.
Skyline: n. the horizontal line at the top of the Matrix. Tetriminos fall from the middle of the
Matrix just above the Skyline.
Tetriminos (tetri-mee-nohs): n. geometric Tetris® shape formed by four Minos connected along
their sides. A total of seven possible Tetriminos can be made using four Minos, each represented
by a unique color.

O-Tetrimino: yellow; a square shape; four blocks in a 2×2 square.
I-Tetrimino: light blue; shaped like a capital I; four blocks in a straight line.
T-Tetrimino: purple; shaped like a capital T; a row of three blocks with one added
above the center.
L-Tetrimino: orange; shaped like a capital L; a row of three blocks with one added
above the right side.
J-Tetrimino: dark blue; shaped like a capital J; a row of three blocks with one added
above the left side.
S-Tetrimino: green; shaped like a capital S; two stacked horizontal dominoes with the
top one offset to the right.
Z-Tetrimino: red; shaped like a capital Z; two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top
one offset to the left.
Tetris® (tet-ris): n. the result of using a vertical I-Tetrimino to clear four lines at the same time, the
maximum possible, for a large scoring bonus. The plural form is Tetrises (for example, Back-toBack Tetrises).
Top Out: n. the Game Over Condition occurring when the player receiving New Blocks Lines
forces that player’s existing Blocks to reach to the top of the Buffer Zone and past the Top
Out Line.
Top Out Line: n. the ceiling of the Buffer Zone, 20 rows above the Skyline. This is the absolute
topmost line in Tetris.
T-Slot: n. any Block formation such that when the T-Tetrimino is spun into it, any three of the four
cells diagonally adjacent to the center of the T-Tetrimino are occupied by existing Blocks.
T-Spin: n. this action can be achieved by first landing a T-Tetrimino, and before it Locks Down,
rotating it in a T-Slot.

2.2 Title Screen & Logo
The Tetris logo is comprised of two parts: 1) the “T” and 2) the “Font”.
Blue Planet Software provides a color EPS file of the Tetris logo online. The logo can be used only
in the approved sizes, proportions, and colors. A ® symbol must be placed next to the top right
corner of the logo as illustrated below. In addition, the font must be proportional to the “T” as
seen in the image below.

For more information about proper usage of the Tetris logo, refer to the Tetris
Marketing Guideline.

2.2.1  Logo Placement & Size
Placement: on title, legal, or splash screens, the logo must be centered horizontally on the
screen. Vertically, it must be at least as high as the center of the screen, and not be directly
touching the top of the screen.
Size: for small screens (non-TV or monitors), especially vertically oriented ones, the width of the
logo must take up at least 2/3 of the width of the screen. On 4:3 aspect screens, the width
should be at least 1/2 of the width of the screen. On widescreens, it should be at least 1/3 of
the width of the screen.

2.3 Main Menu
At the Main Menu, the player may select the number of players, the game variation, and
the starting level. The player may access the High Score Table and Help. The player may also
customize various other settings, such as the basic key configuration and sounds.

1.  The Matrix
The Matrix is the area where game play occurs. Standard Matrix dimensions are 20 cells high by
10 cells wide.
2.  Tetrimino in Play
The player can manipulate this Tetrimino by moving it right or left, rotating it clockwise or
counterclockwise, and Hard or Soft Dropping it. Hard Dropping results in the Tetrimino instantly
dropping straight down and Locking Down on the first Surface on which it lands. Soft Dropping
drops the Tetrimino 20 times faster than the current Fall Speed until the button is released.
3.  Next Queue
The Next Queue allows the player to see the Next Tetrimino that will be generated and put into
play. It should be located near the top-right of the Matrix. Ideally, the next six Tetriminos should
be visible in this queue, but this can vary anywhere from one to six. The queue can be vertical
or horizontal, where the Next Tetrimino to enter the Matrix is closest to the top of the Matrix. The
Tetriminos must have the following North Facing orientations in the Next Queue:

Page 6 of 90

© 2009, Blue Planet Software, Inc.

Basic Game Flowchart
If animation is provided for Tetriminos in the Next Queue, first priority goes to them being very
easy to distinguish in a player’s peripheral vision.
4.  Ghost Piece
The Ghost Piece is a copy of the Tetrimino in play and indicates to the player where the
Tetrimino in play will come to rest if it is “dropped” from its current position. The Ghost Piece can
appear as a Tetrimino outline or as a translucent “ghost” image of the Tetrimino. It first appears,
always North Facing, at the moment of the generation of the Next Tetrimino.
5.  Background Graphic
The Background Graphic is the backdrop on which the screen elements appear. It gives the
product character and polish. The background must not visually interfere with game play.
6.  Starting Blocks
With several Tetris product variations, the player can vary the number of rows of Starting Blocks
that appear at the bottom of the Matrix at the start of a game.
7.  Game Information
Information relevant to the game being played is displayed on-screen. Possible fields are:
• Game Type
• Number of Lines Cleared / Number of Lines Left to Clear
• Current Level
• Time Elapsed / Time Remaining
• Current Score
• High Score
• Player Name
• Player Rank
8.  Hold Queue
The Hold Queue allows the player to “hold” a falling Tetrimino for as long as they wish. Holding
a Tetrimino releases the Tetrimino already in the Hold Queue (if one exists). It is located near the
top-left of the Matrix. The Tetriminos are always represented North Facing, just as in the
Next Queue.

2.5 Options
2.5.1  Next Queue
The Next Queue may be customized by setting the number of Tetriminos to appear in the
queue. Sometimes this number is dependent on platform, but ranges from one to six.

2.5.2  Hold Queue
The Hold Queue may be turned on or off. The default must be set to on.

2.5.3  Ghost Piece
The Ghost Piece feature may be turned on or off. The default must be set to on.

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009

2.5.4  Lock Down
A Tetrimino that is Hard Dropped Locks Down immediately. However, if a Tetrimino naturally falls
or Soft Drops onto a Surface, it is given 0.5 seconds on a Lock Down Timer before it actually
Locks Down. Three rulesets—Infinite Placement, Extended, and Classic—dictate the conditions
for Lock Down. The default is Extended Placement.

2.5.5  Background Music (BGM)
The background music may be turned on or off. The default must be set to on. The background
music volume may be adjusted. The player may also select a soundtrack from a list, or select
Random Play which will cycle through the songs between games or levels. For the list of songs,
see the Background Music section under Visual/Sound Effects & Music.

2.5.6  Sound Effects
The sound effects may be turned on or off. The default must be set to on. The sound effect
volume may be adjusted.

2.6 Help
The Help is used to teach the player how to play, the scoring system used, and to display other
basic game play topics. Use the correct Tetris terminology in the Help. For example, do not
refer to the Matrix as the “Grid” or a Tetrimino as a “Block”. Refer to the Tetris Glossary for the
correct terminology.
In many games, the Help contains a section for the game credits. See the In-Game and Game
Manual Credits section in the Tetris Marketing Guideline for game credit requirements.

Tetrimino Generation
3. Tetrimino Generation
Each Tetrimino is made up of four Minos. The size of a Mino is the same size as a Matrix cell.

3.1 Colored Tetriminos
The following is the standard color scheme for the seven Tetriminos:

YELLOW

LIGHT BLUE

PURPLE

ORANGE

DARK BLUE

GREEN

RED

3.2 Monochrome Tetriminos
In versions that use monochrome screens, or when hardware limitations disallow all colors to be
used, the Tetriminos should have distinct hues and patterns to differentiate themselves.

3.3 Random Generation
Tetris uses a “bag” system to determine the sequence of Tetriminos that appear during game
play. This system allows for equal distribution among the seven Tetriminos.
The seven different Tetriminos are placed into a virtual bag, then shuffled into a random order.
This order is the sequence that the bag “feeds” the Next Queue. Every time a new Tetrimino is
generated and starts its fall within the Matrix, the Tetrimino at the front of the line in the bag is
placed at the end of the Next Queue, pushing all Tetriminos in the Next Queue forward by one.
The bag is refilled and reshuffled once it is empty.

3.4 Starting Location & Orientation
Tetriminos are all generated North Facing (just as they appear in the Next Queue) on the 21st
and 22nd rows, just above the Skyline. There are 10 cells across the Matrix, and every Tetrimino
that is three Minos wide is generated on the 4th cell across and stretches to the 6th. This
includes the T-Tetrimino, L-Tetrimino, J-Tetrimino, S-Tetrimino and Z-Tetrimino. The I-Tetrimino and
O-Tetrimino are exactly centered at generation. The I-Tetrimino is generated on the 21st row
(not 22nd), stretching from the 4th to 7th cells. The O-Tetrimino is generated on the 5th and
6th cell.

Page 9 of 90

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009
As soon as a Tetrimino is generated, three things immediately happen: 1) the Tetrimino drops
one row if no existing Block is in its path, 2) the player is able to move and rotate the Tetrimino,
and 3) the Ghost Piece (if turned on) appears below, North Facing. If an existing Block is in the
Tetrimino’s path, the Tetrimino does not drop one row immediately, however, a few pixels of the
generated Tetrimino are shown (hardware permitting) to help the player manipulate it above
the Skyline.

When a Tetrimino generates,
any tap to the left of Line
A is considered a counterclockwise rotation; any
tap to the right of Line A
is considered a clockwise
rotation.
If the Tetrimino is rotated
counter-clockwise, Line B
is made the dividing line
between counter-clockwise
and clockwise rotations. This
continues until the Tetrimino
is rotated clockwise, at which
time the dividing line moves
back to Line A.
At Lock Down, the dividing
line is reset to Line A.

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009

5. Tetrimino Manipulation
Only one Tetrimino falls within the Matrix at any given time. The player can move, rotate, Soft
Drop, Hard Drop, and Hold the falling Tetrimino (i.e., the Tetrimino in play). When the Tetrimino
first lands on a Surface, there is a time limit before it Locks Down. The three Lock Down options
are explained at the end of this section.

5.1 Movement
The Tetrimino in play falls from just above the Skyline one cell at a time, and moves left and
right one cell at a time. Each Mino of a Tetrimino “snaps” to the appropriate cell position at the
completion of a move, although intermediate Tetrimino movement appears smooth. Only right,
left, and downward movement are allowed. Movement into occupied cells and Matrix walls
and floors is not allowed.

5.2 Auto-Repeat
Tapping the move button allows a single cell movement of the Tetrimino in the direction
pressed. Holding down the move button triggers an Auto-Repeat movement that allows the
player to move a Tetrimino from one side of the Matrix to the other in about 0.5 seconds. This is
essential on higher levels when the Fall Speed of a Tetrimino is very fast.
There must be a slight delay between the time the move button is pressed and the time when
Auto-Repeat kicks in, roughly 0.3 seconds. This delay prevents unwanted extra movement of a
Tetrimino. Auto-Repeat only affects Left/Right movement. Auto-Repeat continues to the Next
Tetrimino (after Lock Down) as long as the move button remains pressed.
In addition, when Auto-Repeat begins, and the player then holds the opposite direction button,
the Tetrimino must then begin moving the opposite direction with the initial delay. This mainly
applies to devices with movement buttons—such as a keyboard or mobile phone—where more
than one direction button is able to be pressed simultaneously. When any single button is then
released, the Tetrimino should again move in the direction still held, with the Auto-Repeat delay
of roughly 0.3 seconds applied once more.

5.3 Rotation
Tetriminos can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise using the Super Rotation System. This
system allows Tetrimino rotation in situations that the original Classic Rotation System did not
allow, such as rotating against walls. See the Super Rotation System section in Appendix A for
more details.
Each time a rotation button is pressed, the Tetrimino in play rotates 90 degrees in the clockwise
or counterclockwise direction. Rotation can be performed while the Tetrimino is AutoRepeating left or right. There is no Auto-Repeat for rotation itself.

5.4 Hard Drop
The Hard Drop command instantly drops the Tetrimino and locks it down on the Surface directly
below it. The time it takes for a Hard Dropped Tetrimino to fall from its current location to Lock
Down is 0.0001 seconds. There is no Auto-Repeat for a Hard Drop.

Page 16 of 90

© 2009, Blue Planet Software, Inc.

Tetrimino Manipulation
5.5 Soft Drop
When the Soft Drop command is pressed, the Tetrimino in play drops at a rate 20 times faster
than the normal Fall Speed, measured in seconds per line. The Tetrimino resumes its normal
Fall Speed once the Soft Drop button is released. For example, if the normal Fall Speed is 0.5
seconds per line, then the Soft Drop speed is (0.5 / 20) = 0.025 seconds per line.
Note that if the player Soft Drops a Tetrimino until it lands on a Surface, Lock Down does not
occur until the Lock Down Timer hits zero.
Press and hold the Soft Drop button to continue the downward movement. Soft Drop continues
to the Next Tetrimino (after Lock Down) as long as the button remains pressed.

5.6 Hold
Using the Hold command places the Tetrimino in play into the Hold Queue. The previously
held Tetrimino (if one exists) will then start falling from the top of the Matrix, beginning from its
generation position and North Facing orientation. Only one Tetrimino may be held at a time.
A Lock Down must take place between Holds. For example, at the beginning, the first Tetrimino
is generated and begins to fall. The player decides to hold this Tetrimino. Immediately the Next
Tetrimino is generated from the Next Queue and begins to fall. The player must first Lock Down
this Tetrimino before holding another Tetrimino. In other words, you may not Hold the same
Tetrimino more than once.

5.7 Extended Placement Lock Down
This is the default Lock Down setting in the Options menu. Multiplayer and Arcade variations of
Tetris must use this type of Lock Down.
Once the Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface in the Matrix, the Lock Down Timer starts counting
down from 0.5 seconds. Once it hits zero, the Tetrimino Locks Down and the Next Tetrimino’s
generation phase starts. The Lock Down Timer resets to 0.5 seconds if the player simply moves
or rotates the Tetrimino. In Extended Placement, a Tetrimino gets 15 left/right movements or
rotations before it Locks Down, regardless of the time left on the Lock Down Timer. However, if
the Tetrimino falls one row below the lowest row yet reached, this counter is reset. In all other
cases, it is not reset.

Note: If a Tetrimino falls to its lowest line and then goes above this line, it will continue to use its
15 movements/rotations. Once these movements/rotations have been used, the Lock Down
Timer will not be reset and the Tetrimino will Lock Down immediately on the first Surface it
touches. If it does not touch a Surface, it may be moved/rotated further. It will again receive a
total of 15 movements/rotations it if falls to a line below the previous lowest line.

5.8 Infinite Placement Lock Down
Once the Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface in the Matrix, the Lock Down Timer starts counting
down from 0.5 seconds. Once it hits zero, the Tetrimino Locks Down and the Next Tetrimino’s
generation phase starts. However, the Lock Down Timer resets to 0.5 seconds if the player simply
moves or rotates the Tetrimino. Thus, Infinite Placement allows the player to continue movement
and rotation of a Tetrimino as long as there is an actual change in its position or orientation
before the timer expires.

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009

5.9 Classic Lock Down
Classic Lock Down rules apply if Infinite Placement and Extended Placement are turned off.
Like Infinite Placement, the Lock Down Timer starts counting down from 0.5 seconds once the
Tetrimino in play lands on a Surface. The y-coordinate of the Tetrimino must decrease (i.e., the
Tetrimino falls further down in the Matrix) in order for the timer to be reset.

Page 18 of 90

Levels & Goals
6. Levels & Goals
Typical Tetris variants feature 15 levels of play (from 1 to 15). A Level Up occurs when the player
clears the required number of lines per level, or the Goal.
The current level affects both Fall Speed and scoring in Tetris (see next section). As levels
advance, the Fall Speed increases, and more points are awarded for actions such as Line
Clears and T-Spins.
We recommend you choose the type of goal system that best suits the variant/platform. There
are two listed in this guideline: the Fixed Goal System requires 10 lines each level through level
15, and the Variable Goal System requires that the player clears 5 lines at level 1, 10 lines at
level 2, 15 at level 3 and so on, adding an additional five lines to the Goal each level through
15. Thus, with the Fixed Goal System, the player must clear 150 lines through level 15, whereas
with the Variable Goal System of adding 5 lines per level, the player is required to clear 600 lines
by level 15. This system also includes line bonuses to help speed up the game, as explained
below.
The player must also have the option of starting from any level by changing the starting level in
the Main Menu. For the Fixed Goal System, for any starting level greater than one, the player’s
Goal is equal to the total number of lines they would normally clear on their way prior to the
current level, in addition to the current level’s normal Goal.

Example: If the player begins on level 4, in order to advance to level 5 they are required to
clear the 30 lines through level 3 plus the 10 lines through level 4, for a total of 40 lines, where
they then reach level 5 with a Goal of 10. For Level > 1, Goal = 10 x Level for that level only.
And, since scoring is dependent on level, starting at a higher level results in more total points at
the end of the game.
When starting from Level 2 or higher in the Variable Goal System: Goal = Level x 5. Thus players
playing the entire game from level 1 through 15 will achieve the higher score on average.

6.1 Variable Goal System & Line Clears
To speed up the process of “clearing” 600 lines, in the Variable Goal System the number of Line
Clears awarded for any action is directly based off the score of the action performed (score
at level 1 / 100 = Total Line Clears), such as a T-Spin or Tetris. This also has the side benefit of
motivating players to use higher scoring actions such as T-Spins and Tetrises. The following is a
table of awarded Line Clears for the Variable Goal System:

Once a Tetrimino is generated, it immediately drops
one row (if no existing Block is in its path). From here,
it begins its descent to the bottom of the Matrix. The
Tetrimino will fall at its normal Fall Speed whether or
not it is being manipulated by the player. The normal
Fall Speed is defined here to be the time it takes a
Tetrimino to fall by one line. The current level of the
game determines the normal Fall Speed using the
following equation:

(0.8 - ((level - 1) * 0.007)) (level-1)

Approximate calculations of the Fall Speed for levels
1 through 15 are shown in the table to the left.

7.1 Drop Speeds
The Soft Drop speed is suggested to be 20 times faster than the normal Fall Speed of the
Tetrimino. The suggested Hard Drop speed is 0.0001 seconds.

Scoring
8. Scoring
The player scores points by performing Single, Double, Triple, and Tetris Line Clears, as well as
T-Spins and Mini T-Spins. Soft and Hard Drops also award points. There is a special bonus for
Back-to-Backs, which is when two actions such as a Tetris and T-Spin Double (see complete
list below) take place without a Single, Double, or Triple Line Clear occurring between them.
Scoring for Line Clears, T-Spins, and Mini T-Spins are level dependent, while Hard and Soft Drop
point values remain constant. Levels typically start at 1 and end at 15.

Note: An added requirement for this year’s Tetris products is to include a demonstration within
the actual application of all of the following point-scoring actions:

a Tetrimino without clearing a line or holding a Tetrimino does not break the
Back-to-Back sequence.

9. T-Spins
A T-Spin or Mini T-Spin is a special rotation of the T-Tetrimino into a T-Slot, and when
accomplished, awards a scoring or line bonus in most variants. A T-Slot is defined as any Block
formation such that when the T-Tetrimino is spun in it, any three of the four cells diagonally
adjacent to the center of the T-Tetrimino are occupied by existing Blocks. In order to be
considered a T-Spin or Mini T-Spin, the T-Tetrimino must spin clockwise or counterclockwise first
(it cannot merely be moved or dropped into a T-Slot). In addition to a scoring or other bonus,
T-Spins and Mini T-Spins can also continue a Back-to-Back sequence.

9.1.1  T-Spin
A rotation is considered a T-Spin if any of the following conditions are met:
• Sides A and B + (C or D) are touching a Surface when the Tetrimino Locks Down.
• The T-Tetrimino fills a T-Slot completely with no holes.
• Rotation Point 5 is used to rotate the Tetrimino into the T-Slot (see the Super Rotation
System section in Appendix A). Any further rotation will be considered a T-Spin, not a
Mini T-Spin.

9.1.2  Mini T-Spin
A rotation is considered a Mini T-Spin if either of the following conditions are met:
• Sides C and D + (A or B) are touching a Surface when the Tetrimino Locks Down.
• The T-Tetrimino creates holes in a T-Slot. However, if Rotation Point 5 was used to rotate
the Tetrimino into the T-Slot, the rotation is considered a T-Spin (see previous section).
The following are some examples of the types of T-Spins and Mini T-Spins in Tetris:

10. Game Over Conditions
The following are the conditions which dictate the Game Over Condition:
The player’s game is over when a Tetrimino Locks Out or Blocks Out, or when an existing Block
Tops Out. This occurs when:
a)  an opponent’s Line Attacks force existing Blocks past the top of the Buffer Zone
(Top Out)
b)  the player locks a whole Tetrimino down above the Skyline (Lock Out), or
c)  one of the starting cells of the Next Tetrimino is blocked by an existing Block
(Block Out).
The Buffer Zone is an area above the Skyline that is another 20 rows high. There are seven
general situations involving this Buffer Zone (each referring to a diagram on the next page):
1.  Lock Down - Normal (Game Not Over)
The Tetrimino in play Locks Down completely below the Skyline inside the Matrix. Most every
Tetris game will be under this condition. This is not a Game Over Condition, and the
game continues.
2.  Lock Down - Peeking (Game Not Over)
The Tetrimino in play Locks Down with at least one of its Blocks both below and above the
Skyline. This is not a Game Over Condition, and the game continues.
3.  Playing Above Skyline (Game Not Over)
The player may move or rotate the Tetrimino in play above the Skyline, an imaginary line
separating the Matrix from the Buffer Zone.
4.  Existing Blocks Forced Up (Game Not Over)
When existing Blocks are forced above the Skyline, but are still below the top of the Buffer Zone,
it is not considered Game Over.
5.  Top Out (Game Over)
This Game Over Condition occurs when an opponent’s Line Attack forces your Blocks past the
top of the 20-line Buffer Zone.
It is highly unlikely that this will ever occur, since Lock Out (see #6) or Block Out (see #7) will likely
occur before a Block ever gets pushed out of the Buffer Zone.
6.  Lock Out (Game Over)
This Game Over Condition occurs when a whole Tetrimino Locks Down above the Skyline.
7.  Block Out (Game Over)
This Game Over Condition occurs when part of a newly-generated Tetrimino is blocked due to
an existing Block in the Matrix.

11. Game Over Events
When the platform allows, Game Over Events such as End Rewards or the High Score Table
should be included if the player has done particularly well in the game.

11.1 End Rewards
When the player achieves an above average score, or attains a difficult to reach level, the
player should be rewarded with a congratulatory message or screen including special graphic
effects. This encourages both repeat play and player improvement.
One example could be the number of fireworks displayed in the background being directly
related to the player’s score.

11.2 High Score Table
At the end of the game, if a high score, level or time was achieved, the player should be
able to enter their name or initials into the High Score Table. The High Score Table should then
appear with the top players for each variant included. The table should include the player’s
name, as well as level, score, or goal attained, the number of lines cleared, etc. Columns
should be relevant to the Tetris variant.
The High Score Table should be retained in memory and made accessible via the Main Menu.

Main Tetris Variants
12. Main Tetris Variants
The three main Tetris variants are as follows: Marathon, Sprint, and Ultra. For information on
other authorized variants, refer to the Tetris Variant Concepts.

Note: Any Tetris game (which may include any number of variants) should have the name
“Tetris” in front of it, in order to better catalogue and search for the name of the game. Variants
within the game do not need the name Tetris in front of them.

12.1 Marathon
This is the traditional game of Tetris. Here, the player competes purely for points over 15 levels of
play, at which point the game ends. Each Tetris variant using the Marathon method of game
play has a specific Level Up condition.

12.2 Sprint (Also Known as 40 Lines)
The player chooses a starting level, and competes to clear a set number of lines (typically 40) in
the shortest amount of time. The game ends when a Game Over Condition is met, or when the
player clears the set number of lines. This game does not Level Up.

12.3 Ultra
The player’s objective is to a) score as many points, OR b) clear as many lines as possible within
a two or three minute time span. The game ends when a Game Over Condition is met, or when
the time limit expires. This game does not Level Up.

13. Visual/Sound Effects & Music
13.1 Visual Effects & Animation
The following visual effects should be implemented in order to enhance the game
play experience:

13.1.1  Line Clear Effects
When a line is cleared, a visual effect should illustrate the line completion and line removal. The
more lines cleared at once, the more intense the visual effect.

13.1.2  Hard Drop Trail
If hardware permits, a translucent trailing shadow can follow the path of a Tetrimino that was
just Hard Dropped. This helps the player visualize a Hard Drop.

13.1.3  Lock Down
A Tetrimino in play should change texture, darken, or flash when it Locks Down. A texture
change or darkening should also differentiate all Locked Down Blocks with Tetriminos/Minos
in play.

13.1.4  Background Graphics & Animations
Background graphics should not detract from game play in any way. Background graphics
and animations should make clear a change in Level or impressive game maneuvers, such as a
Tetris, T-Spin, or Back-to-Back.

13.1.5  Action Notifications
Actions such as Tetrises, T-Spins, T-Spin Singles/Doubles/Triples, Mini T-Spins, Mini T-Spin Singles,
and Back-to-Backs should have a quick but aesthetically pleasing on-screen text notification of
the action.
The text should explicitly state the name of the action, for example: “T-Spin Single” or “Back-toBack T-Spin Double”. For Mini T-Spins, the text can indicate either “Mini T-Spin” or just “T-Spin”.
Up to level 10, the notification may appear inside the Matrix. After level 10, the notification must
appear somewhere in the user interface, outside of the Matrix.

13.1.6  Pausing the Game
Pressing the Pause button stops game play instantly and hides the Matrix, Next Queue, and
Hold Queue contents. The word “Pause” should be prominently displayed on screen. Pressing
the Pause button again resumes the game.

A1.2 Tetris Phases
A1.2.1  Generation Phase
Random Generation
Tetris uses a “bag” system to determine the sequence of Tetriminos that appear during game
play. This system allows for equal distribution among the seven Tetriminos.
The seven different Tetriminos are placed into a virtual bag, then shuffled into a random order.
This order is the sequence that the bag “feeds” the Next Queue. Every time a new Tetrimino is
generated and starts its fall within the Matrix, the Tetrimino at the front of the line in the bag is
placed at the end of the Next Queue, pushing all Tetriminos in the Next Queue forward by one.
The bag is refilled and reshuffled once it is empty.

Generation of Tetriminos
The generation time of a Tetrimino is 0.2 seconds after the Lock Down of the previous Tetrimino.
This slight delay happens as soon as the Completion Phase is finished. Generation time may
change depending on the handling of the target platform.

Starting Location and Orientation
The bottom left corner of a 10 cell wide by 20 cell high Matrix is considered the origin, with the
first cell being at x-coordinate 1 and y-coordinate 1: (1,1). The upper right cell of the Matrix is at
(10, 20). Upon generation, the “center” Mino of the Tetrimino, i.e., Visual Rotation Point/Rotation
Point #1 (see the Super Rotation System section in this appendix), occupies the cell with an
x-coordinate of 5 and a y-coordinate of 21, which is in the first row above the Skyline.
Tetriminos are all generated North Facing (just as they appear in the Next Queue) on the 21st
and 22nd rows, just above the Skyline. Every Tetrimino that is three Minos wide is generated
on the 4th cell across (4, 21) and stretches to the 6th (6, 21). This includes the T-Tetrimino,
L-Tetrimino, J-Tetrimino, S-Tetrimino and Z-Tetrimino. The I-Tetrimino and O-Tetrimino are exactly
centered horizontally at generation. The I-Tetrimino is generated on the 21st row (not 22nd),
stretching from the 4th to 7th cells (4, 21) - (7, 21), and the O-Tetrimino is generated on the 5th
and 6th cell (5, 21) - (6, 21).
As soon as a Tetrimino is generated, three things immediately happen: 1) the Tetrimino drops
one row if no existing Block is in its path, 2) the Tetrimino enters the Falling Phase where the
player is able to move and rotate it, and 3) the Ghost Piece (if turned on) appears below,
North Facing. If an existing Block is in the Tetrimino’s path, the Tetrimino does not drop one
row immediately, however, a few pixels of the generated Tetrimino are shown (hardware
permitting) to help the player manipulate it above the Skyline.

A1.2.2  Falling Phase
Throughout the Falling Phase, the player can move, rotate, Soft Drop, Hard Drop, and Hold a
Tetrimino. The Tetrimino enters the Lock Phase once it lands on a Surface. For more information
on Tetrimino Fall Speed, see the Fall & Drop Speeds section.

A1.2.3  Lock Phase
The player can perform the same actions on a Tetrimino in this phase as he/she can in the
Falling Phase, as long as the Tetrimino is not yet Locked Down. A Tetrimino that is Hard Dropped
Locks Down immediately. However, if a Tetrimino naturally falls or Soft Drops onto a landing
Surface, it is given 0.5 seconds on a Lock Down Timer before it actually Locks Down.
Page 34 of 90

Appendix A The Tetris Engine
Three rulesets—Infinite Placement, Extended, and Classic—dictate the conditions for Lock
Down (see the Tetrimino Manipulation section).

Note: Using the Super Rotation System, rotating a Tetrimino often causes the y-coordinate of the
Tetrimino to increase, i.e., it “lifts up” off the Surface it landed on. The Lock Down Timer does not
reset in this case, but it does stop counting down until the Tetrimino lands again on a Surface
that has the same (or higher) y-coordinate as it did before it was rotated. Only if it lands on a
Surface with a lower y-coordinate will the timer reset.
If moving or rotating a Tetrimino causes it to fall again, it re-enters the Falling Phase. Once the
Tetrimino is fully Locked Down, it enters the Pattern Phase.

A1.2.4  Pattern Phase
In this phase, the engine looks for patterns made from Locked Down Blocks in the Matrix. Once
a pattern has been matched, it can trigger any number of Tetris variant-related effects.
The classic pattern is the Line Clear pattern. This pattern is matched when one or more rows
of 10 horizontally aligned Matrix cells are occupied by Blocks. The matching Blocks are then
marked for removal on a hit list. Blocks on the hit list are cleared from the Matrix at a later time
in the Eliminate Phase.
This phase takes up no apparent game time.

A1.2.5  Iterate Phase
In this phase, the engine is given a chance to scan through all cells in the Matrix and evaluate
or manipulate them according to an editor-defined iteration script. This phase consumes no
apparent game time.

Note: This phase is included in the engine to allow for more complicated variants in the future,
and has thus far not been used.

A1.2.6  Animate Phase
Here, any animation scripts are executed within the Matrix. The Tetris Engine moves on to the
Eliminate Phase once all animation scripts have been run.

A1.2.7  Eliminate Phase
Any Minos marked for removal, i.e., on the hit list, are cleared from the Matrix in this phase. If this
results in one or more complete 10-cell rows in the Matrix becoming unoccupied by Minos, then
all Minos above that row(s) collapse, or fall by the number of complete rows cleared from the
Matrix. Points are awarded to the player according to the Tetris Scoring System, as seen in the
Scoring section.

Game Statistics
Statistics such as the number of Singles, Doubles, Triples, Tetrises, and T-Spins can also be
tracked in the Eliminate Phase. Ideally, some sort of High Score Table should record the player’s
name, the highest level reached, his total score, and other statistics that can be tracked in
this phase.

A1.2.8  Completion Phase
This is where any updates to information fields on the Tetris playfield are updated, such as the
Score and Time. The Level Up condition is also checked to see if it is necessary to advance the
game level.

Whether the player Levels Up or not, control flows back into the Generation Phase of the
Next Tetrimino.

A1.3 Tetrimino Facings
Each Tetrimino has a North, South, East, and West Facing. These facings are referred to
extensively in the Super Rotation System section. Tetriminos are oriented in their North Facings
when in the Next Queue, the Hold Queue, and when generated.

A1.4 Super Rotation System
The Super Rotation System is the expanded Tetrimino control that allows players greater
flexibility and freedom of movement. Tetris products in the past used a simple means of rotation,
which caused strict limitations as to where Tetriminos could and could not be rotated.
Page 36 of 90

© 2009, Blue Planet Software, Inc.

Appendix A The Tetris Engine
For instance, if the I-Tetrimino was against a wall, and the player attempted to rotate it, the
Tetrimino would not rotate because the resulting rotation would cause the Tetrimino to collide
with the wall. If a Tetrimino with a flat bottom edge (e.g., the T-Tetrimino) landed on a flat
surface or floor, it also could not be rotated. The Super Rotation System allows Tetrimino rotation
in such cases.

Classic Rotation System

Super Rotation System

Tetriminos cannot rotate against a wall
or up off a Surface.

Tetriminos can rotate against a wall or
up off a Surface.

The Super Rotation System allows players to rotate the Tetriminos in other situations where they
were previously disallowed using Classic Rotation. The system prioritizes possible rotations using
five rotation points for each Tetrimino. If a Tetrimino cannot be rotated into the first position,
the game checks a second position by using the second rotation point. If the Tetrimino can
be rotated into the second position, it will do so. Otherwise, it tries the third rotation point, and
possibly a fourth and a fifth. Whichever rotation succeeds first is used; if all five rotations fail, the
rotation cannot occur in that situation.
The system is designed to be as intuitive as possible to the player. If the player presses rotate,
the most intuitive, visual rotation is always used as long as no collision occurs. Subsequent
rotations are less visually intuitive, but still rotate the Tetrimino as close as possible to a Tetrimino’s
“natural” visual center of rotation.

A1.4.1  Objectives
• Provide a New Standard: Establish a new standard of rotation to be used for all future
Tetris products.
• Be Lenient: Allow the player to rotate a Tetrimino when it is against a wall, on the floor
in a “Well”, or in other situations where Tetriminos could not rotate in older Tetris games.
This results in a less frustrating and more enjoyable game.
• Make Rotations Predictable: Make the system of rotations intuitive so that the player
can easily predict the behavior of a Tetrimino when a button is pressed.
• Preserve Backwards Compatibility to Older Tetris Products: Allow the Tetrimino to rotate
as it does in previous Tetris games.

A1.4.2  Super Rotation Diagrams
Each Tetrimino has five possible rotation points. If the Tetrimino cannot rotate on the first point, it
will try to rotate on the second. If it cannot rotate on the second, it will try the third and so on. If
it cannot rotate on any of the points, then it cannot rotate.

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009

Specific Purposes for Each Rotation Point
There are six general situations that the rotation points were designed for:
A.	Visual: The first point of rotation is the visual center of the Tetrimino. This is where a player
would expect a Tetrimino to rotate, and is the point of rotation used in most past Tetris
products. If there is nothing obstructing the resulting Tetrimino position, the Tetrimino will
rotate using
this point.
B.	Off the RIGHT Wall: Point 2 for all 3x2 Tetriminos and points 2 & 3 for the I-Tetrimino are
designed to help rotation in situations where there is an obstruction at the side of a
Tetrimino. It shifts the Tetrimino away from the obstruction, and then rotates the Tetrimino.
C.	Off the LEFT Wall: same as B.
D.	Off the FLOOR: Point 3 for 3x2 Tetriminos and points 4 & 5 for the I-Tetrimino allow rotation
where there is an obstruction below the Tetrimino by shifting it up and then rotating it.
E.	Out of a RIGHT Well: A vertical depression at the top of the “garbage” into which a
Tetrimino can fall is called a Well. Super Rotation points 4 & 5 allow players to effectively
rotate out of a Well.
F.	Out of a LEFT Well: same as E.
Depending on the position of a Tetrimino, the different rotation points will achieve the above
purposes. These purposes are shown on the 5th and 6th (and 7th & 8th for the I-Tetrimino) pages
of each Tetrimino’s set of pages. For example, for the S-Tetrimino, Point 2’s general purpose is
rotation off walls. Using Point 2 in the East position, the S-Tetrimino will rotate off the Left wall if
rotated in either direction. To see how the engine works, first try the S-Tetrimino’s Point 1 for the
East start position. Imagine that there is a wall lined up on the left side of the Tetrimino. Both the
left and right rotations will cause a collision into this wall. Thus, the engine then chooses Point 2.
Because this rotation point results in shifting the Tetrimino over to the right, this point will succeed
in rotating the S-Tetrimino Off the Wall, and the engine selects Point 2.
To summarize,
Point 1 is just the Visual Rotation, for all Start Positions, and for all Tetriminos (A).
3x2 T-, L-, J-, S-, Z-Tetriminos
Point 2 is designed for Off the Right/Left Wall rotations (B, C).
Point 3 is for Off the Floor rotations (D).
Point 4 is for rotation Out of a Right/Left Well, depending on the start position (E, F).
Point 5 is the reverse of Point 4. It rotates Out of a Right/Left Well, depending on the start
position (E, F).

4x1 I-Tetrimino
Point 2 is for Off the Right/Left Wall rotations (B, C).
Point 3 is the reverse of Point 2. It is for Off the Right/Left Wall rotations (B, C).
Point 4 is for Off the Floor rotations, and for rotation Out of a Right/Left Well (D, E, F).
Point 5 is the reverse of Point 4. It is for Off the Floor rotations, and for rotation Out of a Right or
Left Well (D, E, F).

Appendix A The Tetris Engine
2x2 “O” Tetrimino
All rotation points for all start positions are the same. Thus, all rotations for this Tetrimino are
Visual Rotations (A).

How to View the Super Rotation Diagrams
The following diagrams show single rotations in both the right (clockwise) and left (counterclockwise) directions for all seven Tetriminos in four possible start positions, using the five possible
Super Rotation points. The O-Tetrimino will only ever rotate using its 1st rotation point. Since it
has the same rotation points for all start positions, the diagrams for North, East, South and West
starting orientations are combined into a single page.
Each page shows rotations using the five different rotation points. There are six pages for the
3x2 Tetriminos, and eight for the I-Tetrimino. The first page has the Tetrimino starting in its North
Facing orientation, the next has it in its East Facing, then the South, and then the West. The last
pages display the Primary Rotations, which are designed for situations such as Off the Wall, Off
the Floor, and Out of a Well (see section on Specific Purposes for Each Rotation Point).
Each Tetrimino is oriented somewhere inside a white box outlined in gray. The position of the
white box remains constant so that it can be used to visualize the movement of the Tetrimino.
The gray outline is the Tetrimino’s “Visual Rotation Bounding Box”. The Tetrimino will never jump
outside the gray.
The middle column of diagrams is the starting position of a Tetrimino. The left column of
diagrams is the resulting position of rotating a Tetrimino left, or counterclockwise. The right
column is the resulting position of rotating a Tetrimino right, or clockwise.
The first row of diagrams should be used as a reference for each of the rotation points. The
rotation points chosen for a particular situation is the first one of the five that works; Point 1 is the
first point tried, and Point 5 is the last point tried.
Certain rotation points are designed to have specific purposes. The Primary Rotation pages
illustrate the situations for which these points are meant. The red areas designate obstructions
such as walls, the floor, or other Tetriminos. The labels A through F next to various points on the
first four pages refer to that point’s corresponding Primary Rotation diagram on the last pages.

How to Use the Rotation Points
In the process of choosing which rotation point to use, the engine first tries Point 1 of the
Tetrimino in the middle column, top row of each page. Call this point Start-1. It then looks at
Point 1 of the Tetrimino in the right or left column (depending on the rotation direction), top
row of the same page. Call this point End-1. It will attempt the rotation by shifting the right/
left column, top row Tetrimino so that End-1 matches up with Start-1. If the resulting Tetrimino
collides with any other Blocks/walls/floor, this Point 1 rotation fails, and the engine tries Point 2.

Super Rotation Example:
Look at the S-Tetrimino, East Facing, Point 3 rotation. The start position is East, and the top row of
the page shows all the rotation points for this position. Using the Left rotation for Point 3:
1.  Start-3 is Point 3 of the East Facing Tetrimino in the top row.
2.  End-3 is Point 3 of the North Facing Tetrimino in the top row.
3.  Shift the North Facing Tetrimino in the top row so that End-3 matches up with Start-3.
4.  Check if the resulting Tetrimino collides with anything. If not, use this rotation. If it does,
then try Point 4.

Appendix B Multiplayer
Appendix B Multiplayer
B1.1 Introduction
B1.1.1  What is Tetris Multiplayer?
Tetris Multiplayer may be defined as any Tetris variant where more than one player plays at
the same time, either cooperatively or competitively. This appendix explains typical features
or elements found in successful multiplayer games. In addition, it provides direction for the Line
Attack/Counter Attack scoring system.

B1.1.2  Tetris Multiplayer Terminology
Broken Line: n. any line sent to opponents with only one gap in the row. In the typical
Multiplayer Tetris variant, Broken Lines are clearable and have just one gap in a
random location.
Counter Attack: n. an attack against an opponent’s Line Attacks to prevent lines from
appearing in one’s own Matrix. Before any lines from an action can be sent to an opponent,
one’s own Receiving Queue must first be cleared.
Line Attack: n. this attack sends Broken or Solid Lines of Blocks to opponents (at random or user
targeted times, depending on the system used), and can be performed using these actions:
Doubles, Triples, Tetrises, T-Spin Singles, T-Spin Doubles, and T-Spin Triples.
Receiving Queue: n. a vertical meter that accrues opponents’ Line Attacks between Lock
Downs. When a Lock Down occurs, any lines accrued in the meter are added to the bottom of
that player’s Matrix before generation of the Next Tetrimino.
Solid Line: n. a row of Blocks without any gaps sent to one or more opposing players. Solid Lines
typically cannot be cleared.
Starting Lines: n. any rows of Broken or Solid Lines at the beginning of a game. Typically,
variants may use different preset or random patterns to mix up game play during a
Multiplayer session.

Page 79 of 90

Tetris® Design Guideline
March, 2009
Target Mark: n. a movable marker that designates the recipient of a Line Attack. This marker
displays near the middle of the opponent’s Matrix but is only visible to the player that controls it.
Top Out Line: n. the ceiling of the Buffer Zone, 20 rows above the Skyline. This is the absolute
topmost line in Tetris, and only in Multiplayer games where Lines Attacks are sent to opponents
can the Game Over Condition known as Top Out occur.

B1.2 Game Types
B1.2.1  Competitive Tetris Multiplayer
The main objective in Competitive Tetris Multiplayer is to force one or more opponents (humans
or AI) to the top of the screen for a game over. Competitive can be played solo or in teams,
typically two teams of two to three people per team.
To create exciting, strategic, and faster paced games, Tetris Multiplayer games usually have A)
a Line Attack system which affects other players, and occasionally B) a progressively faster Fall
Speed (or some other preset difficulty) as either time passes or a certain amount of
Tetriminos fall.

Note: In most competitive multiplayer variants, all players should receive the same order of
Tetriminos (random for each game played), unless the variant is specifically designed not to
do this.
Examples:
1 Player vs. 1 Player: This could be a standard versus variant with Line Attacks.
1 Player vs. 1 Computer Player: The player could set the computer’s artificial intelligence level
and then play a standard versus game with Line Attacks to see the winner.
1 Player vs. Players and/or Computer Players: Each player tries to defeat all other players
and/or computer opponents. This could be a standard versus variant with Line Attacks.

B1.2.2  Cooperative Tetris Multiplayer
In Cooperative Tetris Multiplayer, one or more players join forces to achieve a goal, be it to
defeat a computer opponent, or clear a set number of lines in the shortest amount of time.
Cooperative Tetris Multiplayer games are always played in teams, however, teammates may
include one or more computer controlled players.
Examples:
Player Team vs. Player Team: Playing to defeat another human team using either the same
winning objective or different counter objectives. For example, a team of three players takes
on another team of three players.
Player Team vs. Computer Team: Playing to defeat a team of computer opponents using
either the same winning objective or different counter objectives.
Player Team vs. Player Teams and/or Computer Teams: Playing to defeat other teams
using either the same winning objective or different counter objectives. Teams may be human
controlled, computer controlled, or both.

Appendix B Multiplayer
B1.2.3  Practice Mode
Whether in competitive or cooperative multiplayer games, if any player potentially must wait
for the other player(s) to finish, there should be a practice mode where that player immediately
may begin playing on the current level until the other players finish or the goal is completed.
If the practicing player reaches the top of the Matrix, another practice session may start until
other players finish the game or goal.
After the goal is completed or game finished, the practicing player(s) may then join in
the game.

Note: The word “Practice” must be predominantly displayed somewhere in the Matrix area.

B1.3 Line Attack System
The standard Tetris Multiplayer game has included a Line Attack and Counter Attack system
which sends lines of Blocks (either broken or solid) to opponents so that they reach the top of
the Matrix and are eliminated from the game first.
Players send lines by achieving a Double, Triple, Tetris, T-Spin Single/Double/Triple Line Clear,
and for Back-to-Backs. Depending on the action achieved, more or less lines may be sent to
opponents (as seen in the table on the next page).

B1.3.1  Broken and Solid Lines
Lines sent to all opponents (if more than one) are identical, appear in the Matrix from the
bottom upward, and are categorized into two types:
• Broken Lines are clearable and typically have a single-cell gap.
• Solid Lines are unclearable, and every line appears as a solid line with no gaps.
Typical Tetris Multiplayer games have Broken Lines rather than Solid Lines sent to
opposing players.

B1.3.2  Gap Randomness in Broken Lines
After every eight new lines appear in a player’s Matrix, the next eight lines have the single gap
in a different random location. New lines ready to be added from the Receiving Queue do not
count - only the ones appearing in the Matrix.

B1.3.3  Receiving Queue
Next to each player’s Matrix is a bar or visual indicator that displays how many lines are
incoming. New lines are added to the Matrix from the bottom up, and appear only after the
player’s Tetrimino Locks Down.

B1.3.4  Counter Attacks
If there are lines in the Receiving Queue ready to be added to the Matrix, then when a Lock
Down occurs, the player first reduces the Receiving Queue by the same number of lines that
would have been sent to opponents. If there are leftover lines, the remaining lines then get sent
to the opponents.

B1.3.5  Table of Line Attacks
The following table shows how many lines are sent to opponents. Before lines are sent, any lines
in the Receiving Queue must first be reduced (see Table of Counter Attacks).

B1.3.6  Table of Counter Attacks
In the following table, the left column shows each of the possible actions for sending lines to
opponents in variants using this system. Along the top is the height (in number of lines) of the
current Receiving Queue before a Lock Down. In the middle of the table are the results of the
action on the left against the Receiving Queue on top.
For example, if any lines were sent (S), the number “2 S” would refer to the total number of lines
sent to the opponent, including the reduction of the Receiving Queue, if any. If an “R” follows
the number, it means the action was not enough to negate the entire Receiving Queue, and
the player’s Matrix is filled from the bottom up by that many lines.

B1.4 User Interface
Design of the user interface depends on the needs of the players. For games where each
player must use the same display device (e.g., a television), more information needs to be
shown on the user interface. For sample layouts of this type, see the Main Menu section.
For games where each player has a separate display device (e.g., a monitor), the user
interface can be customized with existing conventions for multiplayer games. The following is a
sample layout for this type of game. It is not required that Tetris Multiplayer games follow
this layout.

B1.4.1  Game Screen
The game screen is where all game play action takes place. Items on the game screen should,
if supported, include most or all of the following: the player’s avatar (graphical online persona),
opponents’/teammates’ avatars and Matrices, Receiving Queue, Target Mark, Chat Window
(whether a separate window or integrated), Chat Bubbles next to opponents’/teammates’
avatars, Timer, and other Tetris interface conventions such as the Hold and Next Queues, etc.

Tetris Glossary
14. Tetris Glossary
Back-to-Back: adj. describes two major bonus actions, such as two Tetrises, performed without
a Single, Double, or Triple Line Clear occurring between them.

Block: n. a single block locked in a cell in the Matrix. Also known as an existing Block.
Block Out: n. the Game Over Condition that occurs when part of a newly-generated Tetrimino
is blocked due to an existing Block in the Matrix.

Broken Line: n. any line sent to opponents with only one gap in the row. In the typical
Multiplayer Tetris variant, Broken Lines are clearable and have just one gap in a
random location.

Buffer Zone: n. a 10-cell wide x 20-cell high invisible area above the Matrix used to detect Lock
Out, Block Out, and Top Out Game Over Conditions.

Collapse: v. all Locked Down Blocks above the Line Clear fall vertically by the same number of
rows as the number of lines that were cleared.

Counter Attack: n. an attack against an opponent’s Line Attacks to prevent lines from
appearing in one’s own Matrix. Before any lines from an action can be sent to an opponent,
one’s own Receiving Queue must first be cleared.

Facing: n. each Tetrimino has four facings: North, East, South, and West. All Tetriminos appear in
the Next and Hold Queue, and are generated, in their North Facings.

Fall Speed: n. the speed at which a Tetrimino descends from the top of the Matrix.
Ghost Piece: n. a graphical representation of where the Tetrimino in play will come to rest if it
is dropped from its current position. Appears as an outline or translucent image. Begins North
Facing at generation.

Goal: n. the condition that must be met before a Level Up (or Game Completed) takes place,
and is typically a number of lines left to be cleared. The Goal depends on the goal system
used. For the Fixed Goal System, 10 lines must be cleared on each level. For the Variable Goal
System, the player must clear 5 lines at level 1, 10 lines at level 2, and so on. Each level adds an
additional five lines to the Goal.

Hard Drop: n,v. causes the Tetrimino in play to drop straight down instantly from its current
location and Lock Down on the first Surface it lands on. It does not allow for further player
manipulation of the Tetrimino in play.

Hold Queue: n. the storage place where players can Hold any falling Tetrimino for use later.
When called for, the held Tetrimino swaps places with the currently falling Tetrimino, and begins
falling again at the generation point.

Level Up: n. upon completion of a level’s Goal, the player proceeds to the next level.
Line: n. the result when Blocks fill a horizontal line of cells in the Matrix.
Line Attack: n. this attack sends Broken or Solid Lines of Blocks to opponents (at random or user
targeted times, depending on the system used), and can be performed using these actions:
Doubles, Triples, Tetrises, T-Spin Singles, T-Spin Doubles, and T-Spin Triples.

Line Clear: n. when a horizontal row is completely filled with Blocks, it is removed from the
Matrix and is called a Line Clear. All pieces above the Line Clear shift down to fill the space.
Most Tetris variations award scoring or other bonuses for the number of lines cleared at one
time. These are known as “Line Clear Bonuses”. There are eight types of Line Clears:

Single: the player clears one line.
Double: the player clears two lines.
Triple: the player clears three lines.
Tetris: the player clears four lines.
Mini T-Spin Single: the player clears one line by achieving an easier T-Spin.
T-Spin Single: the player clears one line by achieving a T-Spin.
T-Spin Double: the player clears two lines by achieving a T-Spin.
T-Spin Triple: the player clears three lines by achieving a T-Spin.
Lock Down: n. the point at which a Tetrimino in play can no longer be manipulated by the
player. This generally occurs 0.5 seconds after a Tetrimino lands on a Surface.

Lock Down Timer: n. counts down from 0.5 seconds once the Tetrimino in play lands on a
Surface. When this time expires, the Tetrimino Locks Down and can no longer be manipulated
by the player. The Lock Down Timer resets according to Classic or Infinite Placement Lock
Down Rules.

Lock Out: n. the Game Over Condition occurring when a Tetrimino Locks Down completely
above the Skyline.

Tetris Glossary
Matrix (may-trix): n. the rectangular arrangement of cells creating the active game area,
usually 10 columns wide by 20 rows high. Tetriminos fall from the top-middle just above the
Skyline (off-screen) to the bottom.

Mino (mee-noh): n. a single square-shaped building block of a shape called a Tetrimino. Four
Minos arranged into any of their various connected patterns is known as a Tetrimino.

Next Queue: n. displays the Next Tetrimino(s) to be placed (generated) just above the Matrix. If
hardware permits, the next six Tetriminos should be shown.

Next Tetrimino: n. the next Tetrimino that will be placed (generated) just above the Matrix.
Piece Edges: n. the edges, or boundary, of a single Tetrimino.
Receiving Queue: n. a vertical meter that accrues opponents’ Line Attacks between Lock
Downs. When a Lock Down occurs, any lines accrued in the meter are added to the bottom of
that player’s Matrix before generation of the Next Tetrimino.

Rotation: n. the method by which the player changes the facing of a Tetrimino. Rotation
occurs at 90 degree intervals, and can be performed in both the clockwise or
counterclockwise directions.

Skyline: n. the horizontal line at the top of the Matrix. Tetriminos fall from the middle of the
Matrix just above the Skyline.

Soft Drop: n,v. causes the Tetrimino to drop at an accelerated rate (20x the normal Fall Speed)
from its current location.

Solid Line: n. a row of Blocks without any gaps sent to one or more opposing players.
Starting Lines: n. any rows of Broken or Solid Lines at the beginning of a game. Typically,
variants may use different preset or random patterns to mix up game play during a
Multiplayer session.

Surface: n. the top of any Block in the Matrix, or the bottom of the Matrix floor.
Super Rotation System: n. the system devised to enable the rotation of a Tetrimino regardless
of where it is in the Matrix.

topmost line in Tetris.

Touch: n, v. when a Tetrimino comes in contact with one of the Matrix walls or Blocks in
the Matrix.

T-Slot: n. any Block formation such that when the T-Tetrimino is spun into it, any three of the four
